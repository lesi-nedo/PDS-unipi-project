\section{Validation}

I decided to use \href{https://github.com/bjoern-andres/random-forest}{this} Random Forest implementation because it is a pure implementation of Random Forests as described in: Leo Breiman. Random Forests. Machine Learning 45(1):5-32, 2001.
The implementation is written in C++ and can be found inside the \texttt{include} folder of the project. I had to make some changes to the code because during the validation process, I found that it had some bugs.
